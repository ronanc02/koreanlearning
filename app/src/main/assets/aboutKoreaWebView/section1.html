      Varied landscapes
    </h2>
    <p>
      The geography of South Korea is particularly varied. Forming a peninsula of around 100,000 km², it has no land border other than the one it shares with North Korea, along the 38th parallel. The relief of the Land of the Morning Calm can be divided into four main regions: high mountain ranges and narrow coastal plains in the east; vast coastal plains, river basins and rolling hills to the west; a southwestern region of mountains and valleys; a southeastern region dominated by the wide basin of the Nakdong River. Along its mostly steep coastline, more than 3,000 islands, some of them volcanic, are part of South Korea's seascape.

      A preserved natural heritage
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thanks to varied ecosystems, well marked seasons and a geography of mountains, coasts but also plains and river valleys, the fauna and flora of South Korea are of great diversity. You will find endemic species such as the Korean hare, the water deer, the Korean fir or the Mugunghwa, the country's national flower. As for the tigers, leopards, bears and lynxes that once inhabited the peninsula, they are unfortunately on the verge of extinction. However, since the early 2000s, South Korea has taken care of its environment, protected more and more areas and developed a particularly effective “green growth” policy.

      Who are the Koreans?
    </h2>
    <p>With a population of more than 51 million inhabitants in a territory five times smaller than France, the land of the morning calm has a very high density. Looking closely at South Korea in figures, you will also notice an alarming phenomenon: a fertility rate below 1. Other figures such as the literacy rate, life expectancy, GDP per capita or even the percentage distribution of religions will allow you to better understand the economy and the population of South Korea. Finally, significant dates will give you some keys to retrace the history of South Korea.
